\begin{surferPage}[A3+- Singularity]{$A_3^{+-}$ Singularity}
	An $A_3^{+-}$ singularity looks similar to a cusp of the form $A_2^{+-}$ with equation $x^3+y^2-z^2$ except that it is also symmetric to $yz$--plane. The equation is
	\[
		x^4+y^2-z^2=0
	\]
	and is thus symmetric to all three coordinate planes which one can see by looking at the equation
	\[
		(-x)^4+(-y)^2-(-z)^2=x^4+y^2-z^2.
	\]
	The mappings $x\mapsto -x$, $y\mapsto -y$ and $z\mapsto -z$ do not have any effect.

	Similar to the cusp in the coffee cup we may see an $A_3^{+-}$ singularity when sunlight passes through a tee glass:

	According to the introduction of this gallery, the $A_3^{+-}$ singularity can be deformed into $\lfloor\frac{3+1}{2}\rfloor=2$ singularities of type $A_1^{+-}\!$. This looks as follows:
	\begin{Centering*}%

		\includegraphics[width=1.2cm]{../../common/images/A3pm_1}\quad%
		\includegraphics[width=1.2cm]{../../common/images/A3pm_2}%
	\end{Centering*}
