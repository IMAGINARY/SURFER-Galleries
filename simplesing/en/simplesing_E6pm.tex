	This singularity is given by the equation
	\[
		x^3+y^4-z^2=0.
	\]
	We cannot understand the geometry of this $E$ singularity by means of its picture, but we can deform it in two different ways: into two cusp singularities ($A_2$) or into one $D_5$ singularity. These can be seen by varying $a$ or $b$, respectively, in the equation
	\[
		x^2\cdot ((0.5-b)x-by)+y^2\cdot(y-a)^2-z^2.
	\]
	Keeping $b=0$ and varying $a$, we get:

	On the other hand, keeping $a=0$ and varying $b$, yields:
