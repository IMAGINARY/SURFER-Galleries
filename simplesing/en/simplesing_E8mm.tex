\begin{surferPage}[E8-- Singularity]{$E_8^{--}$ Singularity}
	A singularity of this type is given by the equation
	\[
		x^3-y^5-z^2=0.
	\]
	An $E_8$ singularity may be deformed into a surface with seven real ordinary double points by choosing $a$, $b$, and $c$ correctly in the following family of equations:
	\[
		x\cdot((x-c)\cdot x-y\cdot (y-a)\cdot (y+a)\cdot(y-2b)\cdot(y+2b))-z^2=0
	\]
	Fixing $c=1$ and varying $a$ and $b$, you will certainly be able to find values for $a$ and $b$ such that the surface has seven singularities as in the rightmost image.

	We don't give a numerical solution here. Can you find one yourself?
