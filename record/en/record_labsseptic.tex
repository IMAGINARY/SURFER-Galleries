\begin{surferPage}{A Septic with 99 Singularities}
    Oliver Labs constructed a surface of degree $7$ (septic) while working on his
    dissertation at Mainz University in 2004. This is the current world record
    of degree $7$; but it may still exist a septic with up to $104$
    singularities!  
    Labs's surface has the symmetry of a regular $7$--gon (left picture).
    This is visible when looking at the surface from the top (right picture):

      \end{tabular}

    For constructing this surface, Oliver Labs used the computer algebra system
    {\sc Singular} (Kaiserslautern University.) which is well suited for
    computations in algebraic geometry and singularities.

    He used the fact that one can compute with finite sets of numbers in a
    natural way. We know this from the clock; 24.00$=$0.00, 24.00 $+$ 1 hour is
    not 25.00, but 1.00.
