  \begin{surferTitle}A Togliatti Quintic\end{surferTitle}  \\

    Eugenio Giuseppe Togliatti proved in 1937 that a surface of degree $5$ (quintic) with exactly $31$ singularities exists --- a world record at that time.


    In 1980 it was Arneau Beauville who used an interesting relation to coding
    theory in order to show the non--existence of a quintic with more
    singularities. 
    This means that Togliatti's world record can never be improved!

    As there is no platonic solid whose symmetry planes one could use in order
    to construct a surface of degree $5$ similar to Kummer's Quartic or
    Barth's Sextic the quintic with $31$ singularities has fewer symmetries,
    namely the symmetries of the plane pentagon.


 The equation we use here was found by Wolf Barth (1990); we use this one
    because Togliatti's original surface is not easy to visualize.
