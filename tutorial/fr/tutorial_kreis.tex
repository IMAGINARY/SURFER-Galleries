\begin{surferPage}[Circle]{The Circle}
The equation that describes a circle is
\[x^2+y^2=r^2.\]
To write this equation in the formula field of SURFER we have to re-write it as
\[x^2+y^2-a^2=0.\]
The parameter $a$ denotes the radius $r$ of the circle and can be changed using the slider. You can now add a second parameter $b$ to squeeze the circle and to make an ellipse out of it, for example with:
\[bx^2+y^2-a^2=0\] where $b=0.5$.
