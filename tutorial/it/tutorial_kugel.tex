\begin{surferPage}[Sphere]{The Sphere}
The equation of the circle only contains the variables $x$ and $y$. We are still in the two-dimensional space.
The equation of the circle is:
\[x^2+y^2=r^2.\]
If you turn the surface, you can see a tube. This is because there is no restriction along the $z$ axis. If you replace the variable x with z, you still get a tube.\\
Now add the missing term for the equation of a sphere (that is $z^2$ to the circle equation). 
This leads to a sphere:
\[x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2,\]
in SURFER-format
\[0=x^2+y^2+z^2-a^2.\]
What happens, when you turn the sphere?
