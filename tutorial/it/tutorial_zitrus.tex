In the field below you can enter an equation. SURFER then computes the associated surface and displays it. The right hand side of the equation must equal zero, for the computer to be able to understand the equation. 
\\
The equation can contain any of the following elements:
\newline
Variables:
\[x, y, z, \]
Coefficients in the form of numbers or parameters:
\[1, 2, 3, \dots a, b, c, \dots, \]
Arithmetic operations:
\[+,  - , \cdot \quad \textnormal{and} \]
Exponents:
\[ ^2, ^3, ^n .\]
Every point of the coordinate system is represented by a value for each of the three variables  $x$, $y$ and $z$. If the term replacing the variables with the values of this point equals zero, then the point will be displayed. Through a method called \textit{ray tracing} the program finds all such points; they are called zeroes of the equation. All these points together then form the surface.
