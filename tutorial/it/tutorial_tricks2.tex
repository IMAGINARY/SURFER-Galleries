The intersection curve of the two cylinders of the previous example is an infinitely thin line. An infinitely thin line is a line painted with a pencil of thickness 0. Using the formula
\[ f^2+g^2-a=0\]
we can calculate the intersection curves of two surfaces $f$ and $g$. Since the sum $f^2+g^2$ of two squares is only $0$ if both summands are $0$, you get for $a=0$ the intersection curve given by $f=0$ and $g=0$.
 The parameter $a$ distorts the equation: it adds thickness to the pencil the intersection curve is drawn with. If you change $a$ you can make the intersection curve more visible.
