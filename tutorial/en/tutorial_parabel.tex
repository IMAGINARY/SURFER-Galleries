\begin{surferPage}[Parabola]{The Parabola}
The parabola is given by the equation  \[y=x^2.\]
To enter its equation in the formula field we have to write the formula in a way such that it equals zero:
\[x^2-y=0\]
The small roof sign symbolizes the exponent. Thus 
\[ x  \,\hat{\ } \, 2 =x^2.\]
We add two parameters:
\[a \cdot x^2-y+b=0.\]
The parameter $a$ is used for compression and dilation of the parabola, the parameter $b$ to change the distance of the parabola to the origin.
\newline
Insert the parameters $a$ and $b$ in the SURFER-formula and change them. How do you have to change the formula, in order for the parabola to be turned upside down?
