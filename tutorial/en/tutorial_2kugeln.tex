\begin{surferPage}{Two Spheres}
Given are two spheres: one of them is fixed and the other one can be moved along the $x$-axis by changing the parameter $a$.
The equation of the sphere is given by:
\[(x-a)^2+y^2+z^2-1=0.\]
The centre of the sphere is $(a,0,0)$. By changing $a$ the centre moves and thus the sphere.
Try adding a third sphere that moves into another direction.
