\begin{surferPage}{A Cube}
If you increase the exponents of the sphere equation, something suprising happens. The sphere becomes a cube with rounded corners.\\

But this does not hold for all exponents. The equation for a cube is:
\[x^n+y^n+z^n=b\]
where the number $n$ has to be even.\\

What happens if you choose odd numbers? How does the cube change if you further increase the even exponents?
