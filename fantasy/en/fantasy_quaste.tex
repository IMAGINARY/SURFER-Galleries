Did you have a close look at the equation of Quaste? It  looks very complicated.
The figure itself can be described in simple words: the upper border has the form of the Greek letter $\alpha$, the right border has the shape of a curve with a peak. Such a peak is called {\it cusp}. If you drag such a cusp along the alpha curve you obtain Quaste. Surfaces with such a property are called Cartesian products, in honour of the French mathematician  Ren\'e Descartes.\\

Monomials of degree $1$ are $x$, $y$, $z$. Monomials of degree $2$ are $x^2, xy, y^2, xz, yz, z^2$. And so on. The higher the degree, the more monomials we have, and this gives us more possibilities to create more complicated shapes. It is like an alphabet: if we have more letters at our disposal, we can write more complex words and phrases.
