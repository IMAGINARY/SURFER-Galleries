Love-letter
\singlespacing
It can`t go on and on like this!\\
What we have, we have to keep.\\
When we'll meet,\\
Something must be.\\
Together singularity.\\
What's up on singularity?\\
For sure no platitudes.\\
Because what's singularity,\\
Is not wearing down so easily.\\
On a park bench in Grunewald\\
In two to face the rain,\\
Attempts in vain. Girl, take heart! Write me a card!\\
Yours, Bertie! (Erinner Singularity).\\
{\it Poem by Joachim Ringelnatz}

The passion of love is generally connected to the emotional power of a ''singularity''. This connection appears in many forms of art.
